# Food-Calories-Estimation-Using-deep-Learning
•	The core concept of the project is to build a model to estimate calories of the food using image processing and deep learning.
•	A healthy diet is the key to have a good health and body. Improper food consumption may cause many problems like weight gain, obesity, diabetes, etc.
•	They want to plan and maintain their everyday calorie intake by eating good number of healthy foods to avoid weight problems. They are searching for solutions to maintain their diet properly. As a solution, an effective way to maintain the calories is to measure them.

•	The approach for preparing model is done in two modules. The first is detecting the food and the second is estimation of the number of calories in the given food.

•	The photo taken by the user is processed through the developed application. The system that not only identifies the food items from an image but also shows the number of calories the food item contains.
